          The project can be broken into two distinct parts 1. Data analysis and
          graphing 2. The interactive Information system. I have decided to
          separate these two parts into different files so I can abstract away
          the code I am not currently working on.

          <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
          <div>
            The data I downloaded off of kaggle was in csv format but it was not
            ready for analysis as the numbers were formatted as python strings
            with a â‚¬ before the value, there were other issues with the data set
            that I had to fix too. I wanted to make graphs that showed the
            effect different factors had on salary, I wanted to do this through
            a range of different graphs that would be best suited to the chosen
            factor. These graphs also had to be interactive and should allow
            users to hover to see the values associated with a point, filter and
            zoom in to show data between certain points. These graphs should
            also be useful to the end user.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="pt-4">
          <h2>Website</h2>
          <div>
            The website should display the graphs in a way that makes them
            accessible to all users possible so they should have some built in
            accessibility features such as an accessible font such as comic Sans
            which makes it easy for people with dyslexia to read and text to
            speech if possible. The website also has to be able to advise users
            based on an input using the data from the dataset this should have
            error catching so users can not input values that would break the
            program, with my chosen dataset I think a good way to show this
            would be to have a user input their salary, age, gender and level of
            education it would then process this data and tell users if they are
            being paid fairly compared to those with similarly factors. The site
            should also gather some data from users, store it and display it on
            the website in some way. I think the easiest way to achieve this
            would be to store comments in a json file as python works with json
            files very easily.
