            To make sure that the whole project would work, I made sure to
            conduct many unit tests on different parts of the code along with
            whole system wide tests to make sure that all these units worked
            together and did not throw any unexpected errors.

            When I was writing the script to clean the data, I encountered a
            number of problems when testing the program at first it completely
            broke and I could not figure out why at all as it turns out I had to
            specify the encoding type that it should use when it is trying to
            open these files, so you can see in figure 4.1 I specified that the
            file is in the utf-8 format.

            After finishing the code for the data cleaning when I ran it I
            looked at the output and realised that when I removed the decimal
            place I didn't take off the 2 0s so I divided the figure by 100 to
            fix this, seen in figure 4.2.

            While carrying out unit testing on the user recommendation part of
            the website I realised that if I put in a value that led to the
            filtered data set being empty this would then through an error that
            would crash the website so to prevent this I had to make sure it
            would show that there was no data available in this range. This can
            be seen in figure 4.3
          </p>

        <h2>System testing</h2>

          <p class="pt-4">
            When I carried system tests on the website I found that the graphs
            were not being displayed at all, it turns out that the files were
            not being opened correctly and I was getting an error message saying
            that there was no file found. So to fix this I used the os library
            to find the exact path as the relative path was not working
            correctly this can be seen in figure 4.4
