      <h1>Evaluation</h1>
      <div>
        <p>
          After personal evaluation and evaluation by peers I feel my project
          meets all the basic and advanced requirements in a highly effective
          manner. This was done through regular iteration through all the
          different parts of the code, coming back to parts after I have had
          more ideas on how to improve the various parts. Throughout this
          project I have learnt a lot of different things that will help me when
          I go on to do computer science at 3rd level these skills include:
        </p>
        <ul class="big-bullet">
          <li>
            <h3>UI/UX design</h3>
            <p>
              I learned how to make a responsive website using html and
              bootstrap that also was accessible for as many users as possible.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Python backend programming</h3>
            <p>
              I became familiar with how backend programming is done using flask
              and how this backend interacts with the frontend to make the
              website dynamic.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              I learned to use the csv module to step through lines of csv data
              to clean it. I also learned to use plotly to make useful
              interactive graphs that could be exported to html for easy
              integration to a website.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Insight from data</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The analysis of the data revealed that the level of education you
            have primarily affects the salaries of the bottom quartile and the
            difference between the top 10% gets smaller. This has shown me that
            it is probably not worth pursuing a doctorate as it adds a lot of
            extra time to college but it does not increase your salary that
            much.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Possible improvements</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I feel like there are a number of different ways that my project
            could be enhanced but I feel like this would be out of scope for
            this project. A machine learning regression model could be made for
            a more accurate prediction of salary that could include all the
            variables that I have available in my data set.
